<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>KOB stands for “key on board” or “key on base”.&nbsp; A KOB includes
a key and sounder and is typically used by students for practicing Morse code—to
get used to the feel of the key and the sound of the sounder. A KOB can also
serve as a portable instrument, since it’s not permanently fastened to a desk.</p>
<p>I developed the MorseKOB program for much the same purpose as the traditional
KOB. It served me well as a Morse practice set while I was learning the code,
and I use it regularly to communicate with other operators over the internet.</p>
<p>MorseKOB works with Windows 98 or later. The program includes the following
features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simulates a sounder using the computer’s speakers</li>
  <li>Can drive a sounder via the serial port (requires a separate interface
    circuit)</li>
  <li>Simulates a straight key or bug using the left and right arrow keys on the
    keyboard</li>
  <li>Accepts a straight key or bug connected directly to the serial port</li>
  <li>Has a built-in keyer (automatic dots and manual dashes) for use with
    paddles</li>
  <li>Sends American Morse from text typed on the keyboard or from a file</li>
  <li>Reads American Morse and displays the decoded text</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="GettingStarted">Getting started</a></h2>
<p>Once you’ve installed the program and have it up and running, try the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Press the <b>Escape</b> key to toggle the <b>Circuit Closer</b> to the
    closed position. This closes the KOB’s circuit, and you should hear the
    down-stroke click of the simulated sounder.</li>
  <li>Press the <b>Escape</b> key again to open the Circuit Closer. The
    simulated sounder releases with a slightly different up-stroke click sound.</li>
  <li>Press and release the <b>Right Arrow</b> key. You should hear two clicks
    from the speakers.&nbsp; The right arrow key can be used as a simulated
    straight key.</li>
  <li>Press the <b>Left Arrow</b> key and hold it down briefly. You should hear
    a series of dots coming out of the speakers. With practice (although I can’t
    recommend it) the left arrow key can be used in conjunction with the right
    arrow key as a simulated bug.</li>
  <li>Click in the lower left text box of the MorseKOB window to place the
    cursor there. This is the <b>code sender</b> window. Make sure the Code
    Sender On checkbox is checked, and type some text on the keyboard.&nbsp; You
    should hear American Morse being sent, and you should see the decoded text
    appear in the upper left text box—the <b>code reader</b> window.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: if you press a key and the program doesn't do anything, make sure the
  KOB window is active. In other words, the KOB window's title bar must be
  highlighted in order for it to recognize any keyboard input. To activate the
  KOB window, click the left mouse button on the window's title bar.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<h2><a name="CodeSender">The code sender</a></h2>
<p>Go to the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>Open</b>. A file browser window
appears on the screen, allowing you to select any text file on your computer.
For now, choose <i>The quick brown fox</i> from the default folder. The text of
the file appears in the code sender window. Note that the <b>Code Sender</b> is
set to <b>Off</b>.</p>
<p>Press the <b>Pause</b> key to toggle the <b>Code Sender</b> to <b>On</b>. The
code sender starts sending the text in Morse, starting from the current cursor
position: in this case, the beginning of the file.</p>
<p>When the code sender reaches the end of the file, the code sender is still
active. If you type on the keyboard, the text will be added to the end of the
code sender window (because that’s where the cursor is) and it will be sent
immediately. Try it.</p>
<p>Press the <b>Pause</b> key to toggle the <b>Code Sender</b> to <b>Off</b>.
Press the <b>Home</b> key to return the cursor to the <i>beginning</i> of the
code sender window. (Similarly, the <b>End</b> key can be used to send the
cursor to the <i>end</i> of the code sender window.)</p>
<p>The <b>Code Speed</b> setting determines the speed in WPM of (a) the keyer,
(b) the code sender, and (c) the approximate speed expected by the code reader.
You can <b>reduce</b> the code speed by pressing function key <b>F4</b>, and <b>increase</b>
it by pressing <b>F5</b>. (See <a href="#AppendixA">Appendix A</a> for a
complete list of the program’s keyboard commands.)</p>
<p>Press F4 five times to reduce the code speed from 25 WPM to 20 WPM, and then
press the Pause key to play the file again at the new speed.</p>
<p>You can pause and restart the code sender by pressing the Pause key, and you
can restart from a new point by clicking on the mouse to reposition the cursor.</p>
<p>Another way of sending code is to copy text from some other application (a
web browser or email program, for example) to the Windows <b>clipboard</b>, and
then paste the contents of the clipboard into the KOB program’s code sender
window by pressing the <b>Insert</b> key. Press the <b>Pause</b> key when you’re
ready for the program to start sending the text as Morse.</p>
<h2><a name="Key">Hooking up a key</a></h2>
<p><img src="images/bug.jpg" alt="Key" width="270" height="180" hspace="10" align="right">Although
you can use your computer’s right arrow key to simulate a straight key—and
even use the left and right arrow keys to simulate the paddle of a bug—at some
point you’ll probably want to start using a real key instead. You can do this
by hooking up a straight key, bug, or keyer paddle to your computer’s serial
port.<br clear="all">
</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/warning.gif" width="40" height="36"></td>
    <td><b>Warning</b>: Connecting a key directly to a serial port can expose
      your computer to possible damage if you touch the key when your body is
      charged with static electricity. Although unlikely, <b>it has happened</b>,
      so take appropriate precautions. For example, using a USB-to-serial
      adapter cable instead of connecting directly to the computer’s serial
      port can limit the extent of possible damage.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The easiest way to connect a key is to take a serial cable with a female DB9
connector on one end and simply cut off the connector at the other end. You can
buy a Belkin F2N209-06-T serial extension cable for $5 or less at <a href="http://compusa.com" target="_blank">CompUSA.com</a>
or <a href="http://buy.com" target="_blank">Buy.com</a>. See <a href="#AppendixB">Appendix
B</a> for details on which connector pins to use.</p>
<p>But what if your computer doesn’t have a serial port? The simplest solution
is to buy a USB-to-serial adapter. The Cables To Go model 26886 adapter cable is
available for about $15 at <a href="http://compusa.com" target="_blank">CompUSA.com</a>,
<a href="http://buy.com" target="_blank">Buy.com</a>., or (in Canada) <a href="http://TigerDirect.ca" target="_blank">TigerDirect.ca</a>.
See <a href="#AppendixC">Appendix C</a> for a discussion of USB adapters. As
mentioned in the above warning, using a USB adapter may be a good idea anyway,
even if your computer does have a serial port.</p>
<div class="fig-center">
  <p><img src="images/usbadapter.jpg" width="480" height="260"><br>
  Serial cable and USB adapter for connecting a key</p>
</div>
<p>Once you’ve connected a key to your computer, you’ll also need to tell
the program which COM port you’re using. To do this, go to the Tools menu and
select Preferences, then pull down the Port menu and select your COM port.</p>
<p>For the ultimate in realism, nothing beats having an actual sounder connected
to the serial port, but this is a bit more difficult than just hooking up a key.
You’ll need an interface circuit such as the one described in <a href="#AppendixD">Appendix
D</a>.</p>
<p>While we’re on the subject of sounders, you can change the sound of the
simulated sounder.&nbsp; Go to the Tools menu and select Preferences, then pull
down the Sound menu and select one of the alternate sounders. If you’re used
to CW, then the Tone option will sound more familiar at first. The Mixed option
provides a combination of tone and sounder, to help you make the transition to
copying Morse by sounder alone.</p>
<h2><a name="CodeReader">The code reader</a></h2>
<p>Once you have a key hooked up to your computer, you can see how well the code
reader copies your fist while you’re sending American Morse. The code reader
gives a rough indication of the quality of your sending, but it sometimes
misinterprets even well sent code, so don’t get discouraged if you see it
making lots of errors. It does do an excellent job of telling if you’ve sent
too many or too few dots, however.</p>
<p>The code reader is kind of like training wheels: useful while you’re first
learning, but unnecessary once you get the hang of it. However, I still find it
nice to have while I’m on the wire—as a “second opinion” when I’m not
sure if I copied something right or to “take notes” if I’m called away
momentarily.</p>
<p>When you’re using the code reader, the program’s code speed should be set
to roughly the same speed as the Morse that it’s trying to decode.
Unrecognized code is displayed within brackets (for example <font face="Courier New"><nobr>[.-..-]</nobr></font>
). The circuit closure between transmissions is represented by an underscore.</p>
<h2><a name="InternetMorse">Internet Morse</a></h2>
<p>Practicing Morse code by yourself can get boring after a while. It’s a lot
more fun to use Morse as it was originally intended: as a way of communicating
with other people.&nbsp; Using the KOB program, you can do this over the
internet.</p>
<p>Before you start, you should enter your <b>name</b>, and optionally your <b>office
call</b> and <b>location</b>, into the small text box just above the Circuit
Closer control. This is your ID, and it’s how you’ll be identified to other
operators on the wire.</p>
<p>Once your computer is connected to the internet—via a dialup, broadband, or
wireless internet connection—simply click on the <b>Connect</b> button. Within
a second or two, the connection indicator above the Connect button should go
from white to red, showing that you’ve successfully connected to the KOB
server. The server acts as a “hub”, tying together any number of offices
into a common telegraph circuit.</p>
<p>If the connection indicator flashes red and white instead of showing a steady
red, that means the server isn’t responding to your connect request for some
reason.</p>
<p>The number above the Connect button designates the <b>wire number</b> that
you’re connected to.&nbsp; You can enter any wire number from 1 to 32000,
where each “wire” is the equivalent of a different telegraph circuit. The
No. 1 wire is most commonly used.</p>
<p>Within 10 seconds after connecting, in the text box in the upper right part
of the KOB window you’ll see a list of the IDs for everyone connected to the
same wire that you’re on. Whenever someone transmits, his ID is moved to the
bottom of the list, so the station at the top of the list is the one that has
waited the longest since his last transmission. About 60 seconds after a user
disconnects from the wire, his ID is removed from the list.</p>
<p>Once you’ve successfully connected to the wire, you can listen to other
operators or you can open your key and make a transmission, just as if you were
on a real telegraph circuit.&nbsp; <b>Remember to close your key</b> at the end
of each transmission, or press the Escape key to toggle the Circuit Closer to
the closed position.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If some other operator on the wire leaves his key open, when you open
  your key and try to send, your sounder will remain silent. To regain control
  of the wire, press the Escape key twice to cycle the KOB Circuit Closer closed
  and then open again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you’re ready to end your session on the internet “wire”, simply
click on the <b>Connect</b> button again to <b>disconnect</b> from the server.
The connection indicator changes from red to white.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If your computer has a 9-pin serial port connector, then you can connect a <b>straight
key</b> or <b>bug</b> to <b>pins 4</b> and <b>6</b>. Be sure to set the <b>Mode</b>
option in the <b>Preferences</b> window to <b>Normal</b>.</p>
<p><b>Keyer paddles</b> can be connected to <b>pins 4</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>8</b>.
Set the <b>Mode</b> option in the <b>Preferences</b> window to <b>Keyer</b>.</p>
<p>The dot paddle (normally the left paddle) sends dots automatically at
whatever speed you specify in the <b>Code Speed</b> setting, while the dash
paddle is used for sending dashes manually. This allows you to use a keyer
paddle (either “iambic” or single lever) to simulate a traditional bug,
giving you a way to send longer dashes for L and zero.</p>
<h2><a name="AppendixC">Appendix C</a>: USB adapters</h2>
<p>USB-to-serial adapter cables have a reputation for being “quirky”, and
that’s been my experience too. The KOB program requires good performance on
the RS232 control lines (specifically, DSR, DTS, and RTS), whereas it doesn’t
use the serial data lines at all. Consequently, a product that performs well for
general applications may not be suitable for use with the KOB program.</p>
<p>I’ve had good luck with two adapter products. My favorite is the 13-inch
Port Authority USB Serial DB9 Adapter Cable, made by <b>Cables To Go</b>
(product #26886). I like it because it’s economical, compact, and convenient.</p>
<p>Another product that has worked well for me is the <b>Radio Shack</b>
USB-to-Serial Port Cable (catalog #26-183). It’s more expensive than the
Cables to Go model and it’s a bit bulkier, but it does have the potential
advantage of being readily available at local Radio Shack stores.</p>
<p>If you have a desktop computer with no serial port, an alternative to the USB
adapter is to install a serial port card in one of the computer’s spare PCI
slots. I bought a <b>StarTech</b> 2 Port 16550 Serial PCI Card, model number
PCI2S550. It took just a few minutes to open my computer, plug in the new card,
and install the device driver software. With its dual ports it has the advantage
that you can have two keys and/or sounders connected simultaneously, which is
handy for using the program on two separate KOB wires to simulate a multiline
telegraph office.</p>
<h2><a name="AppendixD">Appendix D</a>: Sounder driver</h2>
<p>In order to drive an external sounder from the serial port, you’ll need an
interface circuit like the one shown below. The circuit can be built from parts
available at Radio Shack for about $6. The components can even be made to fit
inside a DB9 serial port connector, although you may prefer to build it in a
project box.</p>
