<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="5"><b>The development of MorseKOB
3.5 is currently on hold, pending completion of other projects</b></font></p>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 7, Vista, or XP</li>
  <li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4: download from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851</a></li>
  <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86): download from
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8328" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8328</a></li>
  <li>(XP only) Microsoft DirectX End-User Runtimes: download from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully some day I'll be able to come up with a streamlined installation
process that loads these prerequisites automatically, but for now you have to do
it yourself. Sorry about that...</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Send me an email at the address at the bottom of the <a href="../index.htm">MorseKOB
    home page</a>, requesting the latest distribution file. (The beta version
    isn't available yet, but if you like I'll add your name to the waiting list
    and let you know when it's ready.)</li>
  <li>Open the distribution file.</li>
  <li>Copy the contained MorseKOB 3.5 folder to your hard drive.</li>
  <li>Run the program by double-clicking on the MorseKOB.exe application
    file.&nbsp; (It's the one with the <img border="0" src="images/icon.png" width="17" height="17">
    icon.)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you wish, you can create a desktop shortcut by right-clicking on the
MorseKOB.exe file and selecting Send to &gt; Desktop.</p>
<!-- h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>There's no tutorial for MorseKOB 3.5 and the Help button isn't functional
yet, but assuming you're already familiar with KOB 2.5, here are some hints to
get you going:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Support for International Morse</dt>
  <dd>The code reader and code sender both support International Morse in
    addition to American Morse. Select the desired mode on the Setup screen.</dd>
  <dt>Code reader synchronization</dt>
  <dd>The code reader automatically adjusts to the code speed of the incoming
    Morse. The WPM setting on the main KOB window has no effect on this.</dd>
  <dd>If the incoming code speed drops suddenly, the reader can get confused. To
    force the reader to resynchronize, click the mouse anywhere in the reader
    window.</dd>
  <dt>Keyboard sender</dt>
  <dd>To open the wire and start sending on the keyboard, type a left
    bracket:&nbsp;[&nbsp;. To close the wire at the end of your transmission,
    type a right bracket:&nbsp;]&nbsp;.</dd>
  <dt>Circuit closer</dt>
  <dd>The function of the circuit closer box on the main KOB window has changed,
    and now works the same in all modes. You can think of it as being a shorting
    switch across whatever key is connected to the serial port. Assuming your
    key has its own shorting switch, you'll normally keep the circuit closer box
    unchecked.</dd>
  <dt>Automatic reconnect</dt>
  <dd>If the program was still connected to a wire when it was shut down, it'll
    automatically reconnect to the same wire when it's started up again.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Setup screen</h2>
<p>Clicking the Setup button on the main KOB window displays the setup screen.
There's no documentation on all the options yet, but here are a few things that
are important to know:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Serial port modes</dt>
  <dd>If you're using the serial port with a sounder driver, then you'll need to
    check the Loopback box so your sounder will follow your key. If you're using
    a loop interface, then leave the box unchecked.</dd>
  <dt>Noise filter</dt>
  <dd>Leave this at 4 ms unless you're having trouble with contact bounce from
    your key, EMI from a sounder (don't forget to use a snubber!), or
    interference when using a modem with a noisy phone line to access a dialup
    hub. If you run into one of these situations, try gradually increasing the
    noise filter value until the problem goes away, and please tell me about
    your experience.</dd>
  <dt>Sound with XP</dt>
  <dd>If you're running XP, you'll need to check the SoundPlayer radio button in
    order to hear anything from the speakers.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Known problems and limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><i>Please help me flesh out this list!</i></li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If things don't work as expected, I may want you to send me copies of the log
files. The way to do this is to launch the program by double-clicking on the
MorseKOB Test.bat file instead of the MorseKOB.exe file. After the program ends,
you'll find two new files in the MorseKOB folder: stdout.txt and stderr.txt.
Send me these two files as email attachments.</p -->
