<h2><a name="starting"></a>Getting started</h2>
<p><i>When you run the program for the first time after a new version has been
posted, the system may warn you that it doesn't recognize the application's
digital signature.&nbsp; You can safely disregard this warning and run the
program.</i></p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure the <b>Circuit Closer</b> box is checked.&nbsp; The circuit must
    be closed in order to receive.</li>
  <li>Select an active wire by typing its number in the <b>Wire #</b> box, or
    change the current wire number by clicking on the small up and down arrows
    next to the number.&nbsp; Wire #101 is a good first choice, because it's
    always active.</li>
  <li>Click on the <b>Connect</b> button to connect to the wire.&nbsp; The small
    box to the right of the wire number turns red, indicating that you're
    connected.&nbsp; If there's any activity on the wire, you should hear the
    clicks of a telegraph sounder coming from your speakers.&nbsp; If the
    connect indicator remains white, that means the program is unable to connect
    to the KOB server.</li>
  <li>The IDs of all the stations connected to the wire you connected to appear
    in the <b>ID list</b> in the upper right part of the KOB window.</li>
  <li>The program does its best to decode any Morse that's sent over the wire
    and displays the text in the <b>code reader</b> area in the upper left part
    of the window.&nbsp; If the speed of the incoming code changes abruptly from
    a fast speed to a much slower speed, the code reader may fail to lock in on
    the new speed.&nbsp; To <b>resynchronize</b> the code reader, click the
    mouse anywhere in the code reader area.</li>
  <li>To <b>disconnect</b> from the wire, click on the connect button
    again.&nbsp; The connect indicator turns white to show that you're
    disconnected.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="typing"></a>Sending on the keyboard</h2>
<p>You can send Morse, either locally or to someone else over the Internet, by
typing on the keyboard.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter a two-letter <b>office call</b>, your first <b>name</b>, and your <b>location</b>
    (city or town, and state or province) in the text box just above the Circuit
    Closer.&nbsp; This is a courtesy to other operators so they'll know who's on
    the wire.</li>
  <li>Set the desired sending speed in the <b>WPM</b> box.</li>
  <li>Uncheck the <b>circuit closer</b> box by clicking on it.&nbsp; This opens
    the circuit to enable sending.</li>
  <li>Click in <b>keyboard</b> area in the lower left of the KOB window to place
    the cursor there and type whatever you want to send on the keyboard.&nbsp;
    Typeahead is allowed.&nbsp; The program highlights each character as it's
    sent.</li>
  <li>When you're done typing, wait for the program to finish sending your text
    and then click on the <b>circuit closer</b> box to close the circuit.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>If you prefer, you can toggle the circuit closer open and closed by
pressing the </i><b>Escape</b><i> key instead of clicking on the Circuit Closer
control.</i></p>
<h2><a name="options"></a>Options</h2>
<p>Click on the <b>Options</b> button on the main KOB window to open the options
window.&nbsp; After selecting the desired options, click on the OK button to
close the options window.</p>
<p><b>Sound</b></p>
<p>Use the pull-down menu to select a specific sound card on your computer.</p>
<p>Check the Mute box to silence the speakers.</p>
<p><b>Port</b></p>
<p>Use the pull-down menu to select the desired serial port.&nbsp; The controls
in the Port panel are enabled only if you have activated the serial port
interface by installing <a href="#rxtx">RXTX software</a> on your computer.</p>
<p>Check the Keyer box if you want to connect a keyer paddle to the serial port
and use it to simulate a bug.</p>
<p><b>Mode</b></p>
<p>Use the first pull-down menu to select your mode of operation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Basic</i>: No external hardware.</li>
  <li><i>Key only</i>: Use a key connected to the computer for sending.</li>
  <li><i>Key and sounder</i>: Use a key and a simple driver circuit for
    connecting a sounder.</li>
  <li><i>Loop interface</i>: Use a loop interface circuit to tie the computer
    into an existing telegraph loop consisting of one or more keys, sounders,
    relays, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Note: In some situations, to have a new mode setting take effect you will
have to restart the program by refreshing the web page.</i></p>
<p>Use the second pull-down menu to specify whether the code reader and keyboard
sender should use American Morse or International (Continental) code.&nbsp; To
avoid confusion, it's recommended that wires 20 through 29 be used for
International Morse.</p>
<p><b>Farnsworth</b></p>
<p>If the WPM setting in the Farnsworth panel is greater than the WPM setting on
the main KOB window, the code sender will send characters at the higher speed
but insert enough extra space—between characters or words, as desired—so
that the overall code speed is maintained at the lower rate.</p>
<p><b>Other</b></p>
<p><i>Code reader</i>: This checkbox enables or disables the code reader.</p>
<p><i>Show versions</i>: Appends the program version numbers to the IDs
displayed in the ID list.</p>
<p><i>Capture timing</i>: Causes the program to display the timing of sent or
received code.&nbsp; Positive numbers represent marks (in milliseconds) and
negative numbers represent spaces.</p>
<h2><a name="equip"></a>Connecting external equipment</h2>
<p>In order to use MorseKOB with an external key or sounder, you'll need the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>USB-to-serial adapter cable</li>
  <li>RXTX add-on software for Java</li>
  <li>Hardware interface (one of the following):</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>For key only:</i> a <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/morsekob.htm#Key">serial
      cable</a> connecting an external bug or straight key directly to the USB
      adapter</li>
    <li><i>For key and sounder:</i> a <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/morsekob.htm#AppendixD">sounder
      driver circuit</a> to control an external sounder</li>
    <li><i>For a local loop:</i> a <a href="http://morsekob.org/techdocs/index.htm">loop
      interface circuit</a> to allow any combination of keys, sounders, and
      relays wired in series to be connected to the computer</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2><a name="usb"></a>USB-to-serial adapter</h2>
<p><i>[Add info about recommended adapters (Cables to Go for Windows and Linux,
Keyspan for Mac OS X) and how to install the driver software.]</i></p>
<h2><a name="rxtx"></a>RXTX software</h2>
<p>Java itself doesn't provide access to the serial port, so if you want to
connect a key or sounder to your computer you'll have to install an RXTX module
specific to your operating system.</p>
<p>Once you've installed the RXTX software according to the instructions below,
all available serial ports will appear in the pull-down list on the MorseKOB
control panel.&nbsp; Select the one that you're using for your telegraph
interface.</p>
<p>An easy way to tell which comm port is associated with a particular USB
adapter is to unplug the adapter, note the comm ports that appear in the list,
then plug the adapter in again and see which one has been added.&nbsp; You'll
have to restart the program (by refreshing the web page, for example) to update
the port list after you connect or disconnect a USB adapter.&nbsp; <i>This trick
doesn't work for the Mac, but the port names are more intuitive on the Mac
anyway.</i></p>
<p><b>Windows<br>
</b>Download the file rxtxSerial.dll (<a href="rxtx32/rxtxSerial.dll">32-bit</a>
or <a href="rxtx64/rxtxSerial.dll">64-bit</a> version) and save it in C:\Windows
(or any other location in your system's library search path).</p>
<p><b>Mac OS<br>
</b>Download the file librxtxSerial.jnilib (<a href="rxtx3264/librxtxSerial.jnilib">32/64-bit</a>
combined version) and save it in Macintosh
HD/System/Library/Java/Extensions.&nbsp; <i>To download the file with Safari,
Control-click on the link and select Save Linked File As.&nbsp; Make sure Safari
doesn't append a .txt extension to the filename.</i></p>
<p><b>Linux<br>
</b>Download the file librxtxSerial.so (<a href="rxtx32/librxtxSerial.so">32-bit</a>
or <a href="rxtx64/librxtxSerial.so">64-bit</a> version) and save it in /usr/lib
(or any other location in your system's library search path).</p>
<h2><a name="problems"></a>Known problems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The speakers don't work well with a bug.</li>
  <li>The speakers can't be used at the same time as a sounder.</li>
  <li>If the wire number is changed while the program is connected to the
    server, it can take up to 10 seconds for the change to take effect.</li>
  <li>If you edit your ID text while the program is connected to the server, the
    change won't be visible to other users until you press Enter or click on
    some other part of the KOB window.</li>
  <li>Audio doesn't work in some versions of Linux.&nbsp; This is due to a bug
    in OpenJDK/IcedTea.&nbsp; Contact me for a workaround.</li>
  <li>The simulated sounder sometimes runs characters together.&nbsp; (The
    external sounder may have the same problem, but it has not been reported
    yet.)</li>
  <li>The code reader sometimes displays letters twice.</li>
  <li>The highlight for the current character in the keyboard window is
    sometimes not properly restored.</li>
  <li>The Mac version of the RXTX software has a bug that causes the program to
    crash when you try to close a port or change a port that has already been
    selected.&nbsp; To get around this problem, download and run the
    ResetOptions program (see the <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>
    section).&nbsp; This will allow you to open a different port.</li>
  <li>KOB 3.0 is no longer compatible with the latest Mac version of Java.&nbsp;
    You'll have to use download and install the version from <a href="http://java.com">java.com</a>
    instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions—no matter how trivial
or obvious they may seem—I definitely want to hear from you.&nbsp; I may not
be seeing the same thing on my computer and I may not have heard about it from
anyone else.&nbsp; My email address is at the bottom of the <a href="../index.htm">MorseKOB
home page</a>.</p>
<p><b>Java version</b></p>
<p>MorseKOB 3.0 requires Java Version 6 or later (also known as version
1.6.0).&nbsp; If the MorseKOB web page doesn't display the KOB control panel,
then visit <a href="http://java.com/en/download/testjava.jsp" target="_blank">java.com/en/download/testjava.jsp</a>
to see which version of Java is installed on your computer.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Mac users who delete the Apple-supplied Java program and install the
  latest one from Oracle must delete the old Java preferences file in
  Macintosh&nbsp;HD/Applications/Utilities, if installation of the Oracle
  version leaves it in place.</i></p>
  <p><i>Also, the Java files at the user level are in
  Macintosh&nbsp;HD/Users/(username)/Library/Oracle/Java. But ordinarily there
  is no need to access the files in there.</i></p>
  <p><i>To access the User-level Library folder, click on the desktop to bring
  the Finder to the front. Hold down the Option key and click on the Go menu.
  &quot;Library&quot; will then be listed as a choice. For some reason this is
  the only way to access it in Lion and Mountain Lion.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Java console</b></p>
<p>If you have trouble running the program, I may ask you for a copy of the Java
console output.&nbsp; If you're running Windows, here's how to enable the Java
console:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the Windows Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Open the Java Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Select the Advanced tab.</li>
  <li>Click on the + sign next to &quot;Java console&quot;.</li>
  <li>Click on the &quot;Show console&quot; radio button.</li>
  <li>Click on OK to close the Java Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Close the Windows Control Panel.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>If you're running Mac OS X, do the following:</i></p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Go to Applications &gt; Utilities and open Java Preferences</i></li>
  <li><i>Select the Advanced tab.</i></li>
  <li><i>Click on the &quot;Show console&quot; radio button.</i></li>
  <li><i>Quit out of Java Preferences.</i></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've done this, whenever you run MorseKOB a Java console window will
open up and display status and diagnostic information for the program. You can
copy this data by clicking on the Copy button at the bottom of the window, which
you can then insert directly into an email message.</p>
<p><b>Screen shots</b></p>
<p>I may also want to see a screen shot of your KOB window.&nbsp; Here's the
procedure for doing that in Windows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure the KOB window is active by clicking on the window's title bar.</li>
  <li>Press Alt-PrintScreen on your keyboard to capture a copy of the window's
    screen image.</li>
  <!--
  <li>Open the Paint program (found in the Accessories folder in the Windows
    Start menu).</li>
  <li>Press Ctrl-V to paste the image into Paint.</li>
  <li>Press Ctrl-S to save the image, selecting PNG as the file type.</li>
  <li>Close Paint.</li>
  <li>Attach the saved file to an email message.</li>
-->
  <li>Paste the image into an email message.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>On the Mac, press Command-Shift-4 (for a portion of the screen) or
Command-Shift-3 (for the entire screen) to save a screen shot to the
desktop.&nbsp; On Linux, use Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Take Screenshot.</i></p>
<p><b>Resetting options</b></p>
<p>To restore the program's options to their default settings, download and run
the program <a href="ResetOptions.jar">ResetOptions</a>.&nbsp; This program runs
very quickly and without any visible output, so it may appear that it hasn't
done anything.&nbsp; But the next time you run the KOB program, you should find
that its settings have reverted to their default state.</p>
