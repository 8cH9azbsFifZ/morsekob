<h1>MorseKOB Documents</h1>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="history.pdf"><b>History and philosophy of the MorseKOB program</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Outlines the major milestones in the evolution of the KOB program,
    provides some insight into its design philosophy, and recognizes the
    contributions of those who played an important role in its early
    development.</dd>
  <dt><a href="structure.pdf"><b>Internal structure of the MorseKOB program</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Describes the architecture and basic theory of operation of the KOB
    program.&nbsp; Written with the non-programmer in mind.&nbsp; Applies
    specifically to MorseKOB 2.5.</dd>
  <dt><a href="cwcom.pdf"><b>Extending the CWCom communications protocol to
    support closed-circuit telegraphy</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Unlike CWCom, the KOB program supports the closed-circuit style of
    telegraphy typical of landline systems, complete with realistic break
    behavior.&nbsp; It achieves this through a minor extension of the CWCom
    internet protocol, as described in this paper.</dd>
  <dt><a href="decoder.pdf"><b>An algorithm for decoding American Morse</b></a></dt>
  <dd>American Morse is much more difficult to decode by computer than
    International Morse, mostly because of its internally spaced letters (C, O,
    R, Y, and Z).&nbsp; Morse KOB’s code reader is surprisingly effective,
    given its relatively simplistic approach.&nbsp; This paper describes the
    algorithm in some detail, with special attention to its unique features.</dd>
  <dt><a href="loopinterface.pdf"><b>MorseKOB loop interface</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Describes an interface circuit for connecting a telegraph loop, with keys
    and sounders connected in series, to a computer running the KOB program.</dd>
  <dt><a href="modem.pdf"><b>Simulating a 300-baud modem in software</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Dialup Morse requires a 300-baud modem, such as the old Radio Shack
    DCM-6.&nbsp; Modern modems often support 300 baud transmission of digitally
    encoded characters (e.g., ASCII), but none of them allow marks and spaces of
    arbitrary length to be sent or received.&nbsp; It is possible, however, to
    use certain voice modems, along with appropriate software, to synthesize and
    demodulate the mark and space tones.&nbsp; This paper describes how.</dd>
  <dt><a href="morsecourse.pdf"><b>The &quot;KOB Morse Course&quot;</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This is a guide for CW operators who want to learn American Morse on a
    sounder.</dd>
