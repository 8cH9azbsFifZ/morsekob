<font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Les Kerr of
Snoqualmie invented software<br>
to use Morse code on the Internet</b></font></p>

<p>Like most young boys of a certain generation, Les Kerr
grew up loving trains and the railroad. He was mesmerized by
the big machines, the sounds and the power, but also by the
men in the railway stations he saw tapping away on strange
little devices called telegraphs.</p>

<p>“I would hang around the local railroad depot and I
would hear this kind of clickity-clack stuff and it just
fascinated me,” said Kerr.</p>

<p>Kerr wasn’t so much fascinated by the telegraph itself
as he was the mysterious language being transmitted across
the copper wires. In his teenage years that fascination led
him to the hobby of ham radio operation, and the language of
radio Morse code, better known as International Morse.</p>

<p>The mystery was only half solved at that point, though,
for International Morse is slightly different than the older
code once used by the railroads and Western Union, known as
American Morse.</p>

<p>“I was very proficient at the radio Morse code, but
[American Morse] was still a mystery to me,” said Kerr.</p>

<p>American Morse would remain a mystery to Kerr for decades
until he found himself volunteering at the Northwest Railway
Museum in Snoqualmie in 2002. There he met James Sackey, who
told him about a computer program for learning American
Morse. Kerr, a retired software engineer, was instantly
intrigued.</p>

<p>Kerr found the program and put his knack for learning
languages to work. “With the help of that program, that’s
how I learned American Morse,” said Kerr. “And then I
wanted to use it. It’s not much fun knowing a code if you
have no one to talk to.”</p>

<p>Kerr set about trying to find telegraphy enthusiasts like
himself, and the Internet proved to be a great resource. He
quickly learned of Morse activity over a dial-up hub.</p>

<p>Those early dial-up experiences were fun for Kerr, for
they introduced him to like-minded hobbyists and took him
back in time. “They would get together over the phone and
chat away,” said Kerr. “And I really wanted to hear that
because I wanted to kind of go back to my childhood.”</p>

<p>Kerr’s amusement soon gave way to frustration. The
dial-up scenario required obsolete modems and some tinkering
with the computer, and it could get quite expensive using
long-distance phone lines. He figured there had to be a
better way and put his computing skills to the test.</p>

<p>Kerr began developing a software program that would allow
him to send Morse code over the Internet – similar to what
some people use for long-distance phone service – rather
than over phone lines. Despite his background with software
engineering, it was quite an undertaking.</p>

<p>“It was a huge challenge because it was a kind of
programming I had never done before,” said Kerr, who had
no experience with Windows-based programming. “I just had
a lot to learn and no one to work with, so that was part of
the challenge – doing it on my own.”</p>

<p>The process took two years, and Kerr’s software went
through several generations before he finally hit upon a
satisfactory iteration, the Morse KOB, for Morse
Key-On-Board, the literal telegraph key and sounder on a
board of wood that we’re all so familiar with thanks to
old movies. Kerr’s Morse KOB program was released July 27,
2005.</p>

<p>Using the program and a few bits and pieces from the
local electronics store, a user can rig a telegraph up to
their computer and send Morse code anywhere in the world via
the Internet.</p>

<p>The program can also translate Morse code signals into
English text (although not quite with 100 percent accuracy)
and can translate words typed on the keyboard into Morse and
send them out using the KOB program.</p>

<p>The KOB itself isn’t even required, since the program
allows a user to send and receive Morse code using the
computer’s keyboard and speakers, if necessary.</p>

<p>The Morse KOB program has been a revelation for
enthusiasts all over the world, especially since the dial-up
hub would soon no longer be an option.</p>

<p>“They said, ‘This is what we wanted all the time,’”
said Kerr.</p>

<p>Some 200 people in more than 20 countries have downloaded
the program, and there’s a small core group who are quite
active online, many of them retired telegraph operators who
are happy to have a chance to practice their art once again,
which is exciting for Kerr.</p>

<p>“Not too many people under the age of 65 have ever
heard Morse code in real action,” said Kerr.</p>

<p>On this day, Kerr is carrying on a conversation with
three men in various parts of the world. There’s Dave in
Missouri, an 80-year-old former railroad telegrapher; there’s
72-year-old Keith in Illinois, another retired railroad man;
and in far away New Zealand there’s 74-year-old Maurie,
who used to code telegrams for the post office.</p>

<p>It’s bittersweet for Kerr, knowing that as this older
generation is fading away, his beloved American Morse will
likely fade away with them.</p>

<p>While watching Kerr click out messages, one can’t help
but be struck by how anachronistic the whole setup is. One
also realizes that the computer connection is a vital
anachronism for those who practice the art – a way to not
forget, nor be forgotten.</p>

<p>“I’m hoping that this provides a tool, like a spring
board, that will allow people who have just a glimmer of an
interest to make it easier for them to get in and allow it
to grow if that’s what they want to do,” Kerr said.</p>

<p>Kerr isn’t quite done with the program yet, either. He’d
like to add some training features, and improve its general
operation.</p>

<p>“It’s a lifetime project,” Kerr said.</p>
