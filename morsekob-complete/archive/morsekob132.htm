      <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

      <p>KOB stands for &quot;key on base&quot; (or
      &quot;key on board&quot;).&nbsp; Typically, a KOB
      includes a key and a sounder and is used by students
      for practicing Morse code — to get used to the feel
      of the key and the sound of the sounder.&nbsp; A KOB
      can also be pressed into service as a portable
      instrument, since it's not screwed down permanently to
      a desk.</p>

      <p>I developed the Morse KOB program for much the same
      purpose as the traditional KOB.&nbsp; It served me
      well as a Morse practice set while I was learning the
      code, and I use it regularly to communicate with other
      operators over the Internet.</p>

      <p>Morse KOB works with Windows 95 or later, including
      Windows XP.&nbsp; The program includes the following
      features:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Simulates a sounder using the computer's
          speakers</li>
        <li>Can drive a sounder via the serial port
          (requires a separate interface circuit)</li>
        <li>Simulates a straight key or bug using the Ctrl
          and Shift keys on the keyboard</li>
        <li>Accepts a straight key or bug connected directly
          to the serial port</li>
        <li>Has a built-in keyer (automatic dots and manual
          dashes) for use with a paddle</li>
        <li>Sends American Morse from text typed on the
          keyboard or copied from a file</li>
        <li>Reads American Morse and displays the text</li>
        <li>Compatible with CWCom and dial-up Morse</li>
      </ul>


      <h2><a name="GettingStarted">Getting started</a></h2>

      <p>Once you've installed the program (see <a href="#AppendixA">Appendix
      A</a>) try the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Press the <b>Esc</b> key to toggle the buttons
          in the <b>Circuit Closer</b> to the <b>Open</b>
          position.&nbsp; This opens the KOB's circuit, and
          you should hear the clack of the simulated sounder
          deenergizing.</li>
        <li>Press and release the <b>Shift</b> key.&nbsp;
          You should hear a click and a clack from the
          speakers.</li>
        <li>Click on the <b>Options</b> tab, then pull down
          the <b>Key</b> menu and select <b>Keyer</b>.&nbsp;
          Press the <b>Ctrl</b> key.&nbsp; You should hear a
          series of dots coming out of the speakers.</li>
        <li>Click in the lower pane of the Morse KOB window
          to place the cursor there.&nbsp; This is the text
          box for the <b>code sender</b>.&nbsp; Type some
          text and press the <b>space bar</b> or <b>Enter</b>
          key.&nbsp; You should hear American Morse being
          sent, and you should see the decoded text
          appearing in the upper pane (the text box for the <b>code
          reader</b>).</li>
      </ul>


      <h2><a name="CodePractice">Code practice</a></h2>

      <p>If you're interested in learning American Morse, I
      highly recommend The Mill program, available at <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~w4fok/" target="_blank">http://home.comcast.net/~w4fok/</a>.&nbsp;
      For additional code practice, however, Morse KOB can
      also be quite useful.</p>

      <p>Open up a file on your computer (or an email
      message, or a web page), select the text you're
      interested in, copy it to the Windows <b>clipboard</b>,
      and then paste it into the KOB's code sender window by
      pressing the <b>Insert</b> key.&nbsp; Press the <b>Enter</b>
      key when you're ready for the program to start sending
      Morse.</p>

      <p>The <b>Code Speed</b> setting determines the speed
      in WPM of (a) the keyer, (b) the code sender, and (c)
      the approximate speed expected by the code
      reader.&nbsp; You can <b>reduce</b> the code speed by
      pressing function key <b>F4</b>, and <b>increase</b>
      it by pressing <b>F5</b>.&nbsp; (See <a href="#AppendixB">Appendix
      B</a> for a complete list of the program's keyboard
      commands.)</p>


      <h2><a name="HookingupKey">Hooking up a key and
      sounder</a></h2>

      <p>Although you can use your computer's Shift key to
      simulate a straight key – and even use the Ctrl and
      Shift keys to simulate the paddle of a bug – at some
      point you'll probably want to start using a real key
      instead.&nbsp; You can do this by hooking up a
      straight key, bug, or keyer paddle to your computer's
      serial port.&nbsp; See <a href="#AppendixC">Appendix C</a>
      for details on which pins to use.</p>

      <p>You'll also need to tell the program which COM port
      you're using.&nbsp; To do this, click on the Options
      tab, then pull down the Serial menu and select your
      COM port.&nbsp; If you're not sure which one it is,
      try COM 1 or COM 2.</p>

      <p>A sounder can also be connected to the serial port,
      but this requires a bit more work.&nbsp; You'll need
      an interface circuit such as the one described at <a href="http://www.mrx.com.au/images/Sounder%20CCT.jpg" target="_blank">www.mrx.com.au/images/Sounder%20CCT.jpg</a>.&nbsp;
      The circuit can be built from parts available at Radio
      Shack for about $5, and the components will fit inside
      a DB9 serial port connector.</p>

      <p align="center"><img border="1" src="images/sounderdriver.jpg" alt="Sounder Interface" width="480" height="320"><br>
      Serial port connector with sounder interface circuit
      inside</p>

      <p>While we're on the subject of sounders, you can
      change the sound of the simulated sounder.&nbsp; Go to
      the <b>Options</b> tab, pull down the <b>Sounder</b>
      menu, and select <b>Snappy</b> or <b>Mellow</b>.&nbsp;
      Snappy has a crisp sound to it, while Mellow sounds
      like the sounder's in a resonator – maybe with a
      Prince Albert can behind it.&nbsp; If you're used to
      CW, then the <b>Tone</b> option will sound more
      familiar.&nbsp; The <b>Mixed</b> option provides a
      combination of tone and sounder, to help you make the
      transition to copying Morse by sounder alone.</p>


      <h2><a name="CodeReader">Code reader</a></h2>

      <p>Once you've got a key hooked up to your computer,
      you can see how well the code reader copies your fist
      when you're sending American Morse.&nbsp; The code
      reader gives a rough indication of the quality of your
      sending, but it sometimes misinterprets even well sent
      code so don't get discouraged if you see it making
      lots of errors.&nbsp; It does do an excellent job of
      telling you if you've sent too many or too few dots,
      however.</p>

      <p>The code reader is kind of like training wheels:
      useful while you're first learning, but unnecessary
      once you get the hang of it.&nbsp; I still find it
      nice to have while I'm on the wire, though, as a
      &quot;second opinion&quot; when I'm not sure if I
      copied something right.</p>

      <p>When you're using the code reader, the program's
      code speed should be set to roughly the same speed as
      the Morse that it's trying to decode.&nbsp;
      Unrecognized code is displayed within brackets (for
      example <font face="Courier New"><nobr>[.-...]</nobr></font>
      ).&nbsp; The circuit closure between transmissions is
      represented by an underscore.

        <p>Practicing Morse code by yourself can get boring
        after a while.&nbsp; It's a lot more fun to use
        Morse as it was originally intended: as a way of
        communicating with other people.&nbsp; You can do
        this either over the Internet or by using
        &quot;dial-up Morse&quot;.</p>

        <p>If your computer is connected to the Internet,
        simply go to the <b>Internet</b> tab and click on
        the <b>Connect</b> button.&nbsp; Within a fraction
        of a second, the Connect indicator above the Connect
        button should go from white to red, showing that
        you've successfully connected to the Internet Morse
        server.&nbsp; The server acts as a &quot;hub&quot;,
        tying any number of offices together into a common
        telegraph &quot;circuit&quot;.&nbsp; Make sure your
        key is closed or the KOB's <b>Circuit Closer</b> is
        in the <b>Closed</b> position; otherwise you'll
        &quot;break&quot; the circuit as soon as you
        connect.</p>

        <p>If the Connect indicator flashes red and white
        instead of showing a steady red, that means the
        server isn't responding to your connect request for
        some reason.</p>

        <p>Once you've successfully connected to the server,
        you can listen to other operators on the wire or you
        can open your key and make a transmission, just as
        if you were on a real telegraph wire.&nbsp; <b>Remember
        to close your key</b> at the end of each
        transmission, or press the <b>Esc</b> key to toggle
        the <b>Circuit Closer</b> to the <b>Closed</b>
        position.</p>

        <blockquote>

          <p>Note: If some other operator on the wire leaves
          his key open (possibly because he's using CWCom
          instead of Morse KOB), when you open your key and
          try to send, your sounder will remain
          silent.&nbsp; To regain control of the wire, press
          the Esc key twice to cycle the Circuit Closer to
          Closed then Open.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>Within 30 seconds after connecting, in the text
        box to the left of the Connect button you'll see a
        list of the user IDs for everyone connected to the
        server.&nbsp; Whenever someone transmits, his ID is
        moved to the bottom of the list.&nbsp; So the
        station at the top of the list is the one that has
        waited the longest since his last
        transmission.&nbsp; A station's ID is not
        automatically removed from the list after
        disconnecting, but you can edit the list manually
        using your mouse and keyboard.</p>

        <p>When you're ready to end your session on the
        Internet &quot;wire&quot;, simply click on the <b>Disconnect</b>
        button.</p>

        <h2><a name="DialupMorse">Dial-up Morse</a></h2>

        <p>Morse KOB allows you to use your computer's
        built-in modem to do dial-up Morse.&nbsp; (See the <a href="http://members.tripod.com/morse_telegraph_club/" target="_blank">Morse
        Telegraph Club</a>'s website for information on
        dial-up Morse.)</p>

        <p>In order to use the dial-up Morse feature, your
        computer must have a V.253-compliant, full-duplex
        voice modem (such as the Modem Blaster PCI modem,
        available for $40 at Creative.com).&nbsp;
        Furthermore, it uses the voice modem in a way that's
        on the fringe of what it was designed to do.&nbsp;
        Although it works well on my computer (a Dell
        Dimension 4100 running Windows XP with a Creative
        Modem Blaster modem), there's no guarantee it'll
        work with yours.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to try the dial-up modem feature,
        be sure to read <a href="#AppendixF">Appendix F</a>
        carefully, and contact me for additional help in
        getting started.</p>

      </dl>


      <h2><a name="AppendixA">Appendix A</a>: Installing the
      program</h2>

      <p>Morse KOB can be downloaded from my Morse page at <a href="http://www.morsekob.org">www.morsekob.org</a>.&nbsp;
      The basic steps are as follows:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Create a temporary folder on your computer.</li>
        <li>Save the download file in the temporary folder.</li>
        <li>Expand the compressed download file into the
          same temporary folder.</li>
        <li>Run setup.exe and follow the on-screen
          instructions.</li>
        <li>Once the program has been installed, you can
          delete the temporary folder.</li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>

        <p>Note: The installation process resets all of the
        program's options to their default values.&nbsp; So
        if you have previously changed any of the settings
        in the Options tab, you should make a note of these
        settings so you can restore them after the new
        version is installed.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>To run the program, go to the Morse KOB program
      folder from the Start menu and select Morse KOB.&nbsp;
      The Morse KOB window should appear on the screen.</p>

      <p>You can permanently remove the Morse KOB program
      and its associated data files from your computer by
      going to the Windows Control Panel and running the Add
      or Remove Programs utility.</p>

      system.&nbsp; If you simply click on the <b>Connect</b>
      button on the <b>Internet</b> tab, you'll be connected

      channel 1005 (the channel used for the regular MTC
      net), with a default ID of &quot;KOB&quot;.&nbsp; The
      server acts like a &quot;hub&quot;, tying many users
      together on a telegraph &quot;circuit&quot;.</p>

      <p>The first thing you'll probably want to do is click

      Using the Server tab, you can switch to a different

      <p>You can also choose a different server.&nbsp;
      However, please<b> do not use</b> the CWCom server at <b>morsecode.dyndns.org</b>
