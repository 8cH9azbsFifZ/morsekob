<h2>Answers</h2>
<h3><a name="version"></a>How can I tell which version of the program I'm
running?</h3>
<p>Go to the Help&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;About&nbsp;MorseKOB menu.&nbsp; The popup
window will display the major version number (e.g. version&nbsp;2.5) as well as
the minor revision level within that version (e.g. rev&nbsp;806-4, which would
indicate the fourth revision made during the month of July,&nbsp;2008).</p>
<h3><a name="install"></a>How do I install the program manually?</h3>
<p>In some situations (64-bit versions of Windows, for example, or web browsers
other than Internet Explorer) the normal installation procedure won't
work.&nbsp; In this case, you'll have to install the program manually.&nbsp;
Here's how:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the file at <a href="http://morsetelegraphclub.org/morsekob/download/morsekob.zip">www.morsetelegraphclub.org/morsekob/download/morsekob.zip</a>
    and copy the folder named MorseKOB onto your hard drive.&nbsp; (The usual
    location for this folder is My&nbsp;Documents, but you can put it anywhere
    you want.)</li>
  <li>The MorseKOB folder on your hard drive contains a subfolder called
    Text&nbsp;Files and four other files. One of these files is a 420&nbsp;KB
    application file named MorseKOB.</li>
  <li><i>Right</i> click on the MorseKOB application file and select
    Send&nbsp;To&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Desktop to create a MorseKOB shortcut on your
    computer's desktop.</li>
</ol>
<p>Run the program by double-clicking on the MorseKOB shortcut.</p>
<p>You can uninstall the application by deleting the MorseKOB folder and the
MorseKOB shortcut.</p>
<p>Note: If you don't already have the <b>.NET&nbsp;Framework&nbsp;2.0</b>
software installed on your computer, you'll have to download it from the
Microsoft site at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com/downloads</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="maclinux"></a>Can I run the program on my Mac or Linux computer?</h3>
<p>MorseKOB 2.5 assumes it's running on a Windows computer.&nbsp; Some Mac and
Linux users have successfully gotten around this requirement by running Windows
emulation software on their computers, such as VMware Fusion.&nbsp; MorseKOB
3.0, on the other hand, is designed to run equally well on Windows, Mac OS X, or
Linux.&nbsp; See the <a href="../index.htm">KOB home page</a> for details.</p>
<h3><b><a name="reader"></a>Why doesn't the code reader distinguish between the
letter L and the figure Ø?</b></h3>
<p>It used to, but in reality I found there was so much variation in the way
different operators send L and zero that the program often misinterpreted one
for the other.&nbsp; I also found it less confusing to have an L instead of a Ø
in the middle of a number than it was to have a Ø instead of an L in the middle
of a word, so I changed the program to always display an L for any dash longer
than a T.</p>
<p>Similarly,&nbsp; <b>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·</b>&nbsp; always
decodes as ES, never as &amp;.&nbsp; I found it particularly off-putting when my
name would decode as Ø&amp;.&nbsp; Try sending LES and Ø&amp; in American
Morse and you'll see what I mean!</p>
<h3><b><a name="copy"></a>How can I print or save the text in the code reader
window?</b></h3>
<p>Copy the text to the Windows clipboard and then copy the clipboard into your
word processing program, email program, or whatever.&nbsp; You can then print
the text, send it to someone else as an email message, or save it as a file on
your computer.</p>
<p>To copy all of the text in the code reader window, <i>right</i> click in the
window and choose Select All, then <i>right</i> click again and choose Copy.
<h3><a name="asterisk"></a>What does it mean when the code reader displays
asterisks?</h3>
<p>The asterisk that sometimes appears in the code reader window is a warning
that an incoming data packet got lost in the network.&nbsp; The packet can get
dropped between the sender and the server, in which case everyone sees an
asterisk, or between the server and the receiver.</p>
<p>In general, a packet corresponds to a single Morse character.&nbsp; However,
spaced Morse characters (C, O, R, Y, Z, and &amp;) are often transmitted as two
separate packets.&nbsp; It's all a function of the sending operator's fist and
the nominal code speed setting on the sending operator's KOB window.</p>
<p>The asterisk is displayed as soon as the error is detected, not necessarily
in the sequence of letters as they're decoded, so the missing character is
usually a letter or two after the point where the asterisk appears.</p>
<h3><a name="overrun"></a>What does the &quot;overrun&quot; message mean?</h3>
<p>If [Overrun] appears in the code reader window, it's a sign that some other
program is running on your computer and taking up too much of the CPU.&nbsp; The
KOB program assigns its highest priority to time-critical tasks, such as
handling the key and sounder, and the lowest priority to the code reader.&nbsp;
If the program doesn't get its full share of the CPU, the code reader is the
first to suffer.&nbsp; The program displays the &quot;overrun&quot; message as a
warning that one or more characters have not been decoded.</p>
<p>Determining which program is competing for the CPU can be tricky, because it
won't necessarily show up on the task bar at the bottom of your screen.&nbsp; By
way of example, here's what I did to solve a chronic performance problem I had
with the KOB program on my computer.&nbsp; During one of its &quot;overrun&quot;
episodes, I pressed Ctrl-Alt-Del to bring up the Windows Task Manager. Selecting
the Processes tab and clicking on the CPU column header to sort the tasks by CPU
usage showed that a process named AppSvc.exe was hogging almost 100 percent of
the CPU.<br>
<br>
By searching for AppSvc32.exe on Google, I found that it's a task associated
with Norton's antivirus software. Further digging revealed that when Norton
updates its virus definitions it performs a &quot;quick scan&quot; of the
computer. This is what AppSvc32.exe was doing when it took over my CPU.&nbsp;
The default settings on my version of Norton cause it to do a
&quot;LiveUpdate&quot; to check for new virus definitions automatically every
four hours. I've since changed the LiveUpdate schedule so that it checks at
least once a day, but at a time that won't interfere with my use of the KOB
program.</p>
<h3><a name="settings"></a>Can I have multiple copies of the program with
different saved settings?</h3>
<p>To do this, you'll first need to install the program <a href="#install">manually</a>
instead of using the normal installation procedure from the MorseKOB
website.&nbsp; In the MorseKOB folder, make as many copies of the MorseKOB
application file as you need.&nbsp; If you like, you can create separate desktop
shortcuts for each copy of the program.&nbsp; Each copy of the program will
maintain its own set of preference settings.</p>
<h3><a name="farnsworth"></a>What are the Farnsworth settings on the Preferences
screen for?</h3>
<p>Farnsworth is a method of learning Morse code where characters are sent at
full speed and extra space is inserted between the characters to slow down the
overall code speed.&nbsp; The usage of the Farnsworth settings is explained in
the <a href="../docs/morsecourse.pdf">KOB Morse Course</a>.&nbsp; This document
also shows how to use the File&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Lesson menu option.</p>
<h3><a name="timing"></a>How can I use the program to check the timing of my
bug?</h3>
<p>If you go to the Tools&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Debug menu and check the
Capture&nbsp;Timing box, the program will save the timing of your keying.&nbsp;
Send several strings of dots with your bug, then uncheck the Capture&nbsp;Timing
box.&nbsp; The program will display the timing of your code in the reader
window.&nbsp; A positive number represents the length of a mark (key down) and a
negative number represents a space (key up).&nbsp; All times are in
milliseconds.</p>
<p>In the same way, you can check the timing of someone else's keying as it
comes in over the Internet.</p>
<h3><a name="internet"></a>How can I check the quality of the Internet?</h3>
<p>It's sometimes difficult to know how well the Internet is performing,
especially if you're using wireless and it's your transmitted signal that may be
marginal even though you can receive fine.&nbsp; Here's how you can set up an
end-to-end test:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Launch the KOB program.&nbsp; We'll refer to this as
    &quot;Program&nbsp;A&quot;.</li>
  <li>With Program&nbsp;A still running, launch the KOB program again.&nbsp;
    We'll call this second instance &quot;Program&nbsp;B&quot;.</li>
  <li>Connect Program&nbsp;A and Program&nbsp;B to an inactive wire—wire
    no.&nbsp;21, for example.</li>
  <li>Type some text into Program&nbsp;A's code sender window and send the text
    continuously by checking the Loop box.&nbsp; (Make sure the Code&nbsp;Sender
    box is checked and the Circuit&nbsp;Closer box is unchecked.)</li>
</ol>
<p>By looking for <a href="#asterisk">asterisks</a> in Program&nbsp;B's code
reader window, you can see whether any packets are being dropped between your
computer and the KOB server or in the return path back to your computer.</p>
<p>Since all data packets are sent twice for redundancy, the program displays an
asterisk only if both packets are dropped.&nbsp; For a more thorough test, put
Program&nbsp;B into debug mode by going to the Tools&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Debug menu
and checking the Debug&nbsp;Mode box.&nbsp; In debug mode, the program displays
a circumflex or caret (&nbsp;^&nbsp;) if just a single packet of the pair is
dropped.&nbsp; An out-of-order data packet is indicated by a degree sign
(&nbsp;°&nbsp;), and an out-of-order ID packet by an underlined degree sign.</p>
<p>By the way, Internet problems can cause characters to be dropped, but they
won't cause the timing of individual characters to be distorted.&nbsp; In other
words, if someone sends dididit and it comes to you as dididah, that's a timing
problem with his computer or yours, not the Internet.</p>
<h3><a name="port"></a>How can I tell which comm port my USB adapter is on?</h3>
<p>If you go to the Tools &gt; Preferences menu and pull down the Ports list,
all the available comm ports are displayed.&nbsp; To tell which comm port is
associated with a particular USB adapter, first unplug the adapter, close and
reopen the Preferences screen, and note the comm ports that appear in the Ports
pulldown list.&nbsp; Then plug in the adapter, close and reopen the Preferences
screen, and see which port has been added to the list.</p>
<p>If the Ports list is the same whether or not your adapter is plugged in, try
reinstalling the driver software that came with your adapter.</p>
