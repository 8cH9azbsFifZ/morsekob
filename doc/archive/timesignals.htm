<h1>KOB Time Signals</h1>
<p>Time signals are broadcast on the MorseKOB system on the following wires:</p>
<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><b>Wire</b></td>
      <td align="left"><b>Schedule</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">11</td>
      <td align="left">daily at noon EST*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">102</td>
      <td align="left">continuous</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">103</td>
      <td align="left">hourly clock set</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p>*The daily time signals occur at noon Eastern Standard Time throughout the
  year. During the summer, therefore, the time signals are heard at 1:00 PM EDT.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Format</h2>
<p>The time signals are transmitted as a three-minute sequence of pulses, each
pulse being sent once per second. The pulses are 400 ms in length. The sequence
of pulses concludes with a longer, one-second pulse, which starts exactly at the
top of the hour (or, in the case of the continuous time signals on wire 102, at
an exact five minute interval). Some of the pulses in this sequence are
intentionally omitted, allowing the particular minute in the sequence to be
easily identified. The missing pulses for the daily and hourly time signals are
shown in the following table.[1] The same basic pattern is used for the
continuous time signals.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><b>Minute</b></td>
      <td align="left"><b>Missing pulses</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">57</td>
      <td align="left">29, 53, 56-59</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">58</td>
      <td align="left">29, 53-54, 56-59</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">59</td>
      <td align="left">29, 51-59</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h2>Hourly clock set signal</h2>
<p>A different format is used for the hourly clock set signal. In this case a
simple two-second pulse is sent at the top of each hour. The pulse starts at
second hh:00:00 and ends at second hh:00:02. This pulse corresponds to the
telegraph signal that Western Union used to send for automatically setting
clocks made by the Self Winding Clock Company.</p>
<h2>Accuracy</h2>
<p>These time signals are generated by a copy of MorseKOB 3.0 running on a
dedicated computer with the Ubuntu Linux operating system. The computer's system
clock is continuously synchronized with time references on the Internet and is
generally within 2 milliseconds of correct time. The system clock's statistics
can be seen on the &quot;AC&quot; KOB server's information page at <a href="http://mtc-ac.dyndns.org/ntpstats/loopstats">mtc-ac.dyndns.org/ntpstats/loopstats</a>.
The numbers in the third column show the clock's variation in seconds at various
times during the current day.</p>
<p>A number of delays are incurred before the time signal is eventually heard by
the listener. These delays are described in the following table:</p>
<div align="center">

    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="bottom"><b>Delay</b></td>
      <td align="left" valign="bottom"><b>Estimated duration</b></td>
      <td align="left" valign="bottom"><b>Comments</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top">MorseKOB processing time</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top">&lt;10 ms</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top">Internet propagation time to KOB server</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top">&lt;3 ms</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top">This estimate assumes the time signal
        program is running on the same computer as the KOB server, which is
        generally the case. Otherwise, an additional 50-100 ms could be
        incurred.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top">KOBServer processing time</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top">&lt;10 ms</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top">Internet propagation time to user's computer</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top">&lt;100 ms</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top">This delay will vary depending on the user's
        location and network congestion.&nbsp; A better estimate can be obtained
        by &quot;pinging&quot; the server at mtc-kob.dyndns.org and dividing the
        roundtrip delay by 2.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top">MorseKOB processing time</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top">&lt;160 ms</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top">The MorseKOB program has a built-in delay of
        150 ms. To this must be added an allowance for processing time.</td>
    </tr>

<p>Based on the above analysis, the time signal can be expected to lag behind
true time by as much as 300 ms. Tests against WWV need to be performed to
validate this analysis.</p>
<h2>Break behavior</h2>
<p>For the daily time signals, the time signal program connects to the wire at
four minutes before the hour. At three minutes and five seconds before the hour,
the program &quot;breaks&quot; the wire (opens the circuit), and starts the time
signal pattern five seconds later.</p>
<p>If a user is transmitting on the wire when the time signal breaks in, and the
user continues to transmit after the time signal pattern commences, the time
signals will be corrupted. This will be apparent because there will not be any
gaps where the missing pulses should occur. When the gap for a missing pulse is
heard, this indicates that the time signals have resynchronized and can be
relied on.</p>
<h2>MorseKOB 2.5 speed setting</h2>
<p>MorseKOB 2.5 has a &quot;feature&quot; whereby all marks and spaces are
truncated to the equivalent of 10 dot lengths, based on the WPM code speed
setting on the MorseKOB screen.&nbsp; In normal use, this mechanism helps the
receiving program catch up with the sender in case network congestion causes it
to fall behind.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it also has the undesirable side-effect of
potentially distorting the time signals, making the pulses sound uneven.</p>
<p>For this reason, it's important to set the MorseKOB speed setting to 10 WPM
when listening to time signals (5 WPM for the hourly clock set signal).</p>
<p>This limitation does not apply when listening to time signals with MorseKOB
3.0.</p>
