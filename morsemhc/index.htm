<h2>MorseKOB 4.0</h2>
<p>MorseKOB 4.0 is a collection of Python modules that can be used to create a
customized version of MorseKOB. MorseKOB 4.0 works with Windows XP, Vista,
Windows 7, and Windows 8.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>In order to use the MorseKOB 4.0 system, you'll need to have Python 3.2 or
3.3, Pygame 1.9, and pySerial 2.6 on your computer. To install Python and
Pygame, run the following files in the order given. You can accept all default
settings.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://morsekob.org/python/python-3.3.0.msi">http://morsekob.org/python/python-3.3.0.msi</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://morsekob.org/python/pygame-1.9.2pre.win32-py3.3.exe">http://morsekob.org/python/pygame-1.9.2pre.win32-py3.3.exe</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Then to install pySerial, do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the file <a href="http://morsekob.org/python/pyserial-2.6.zip">http://morsekob.org/python/pyserial-2.6.zip</a>
    and extract its contents (the single folder pyserial-2.6) to any folder on
    your hard drive, say C:\pyserial.</li>
  <li>Open a Command Prompt window and enter the following commands:<br>
    <font face="monospace">cd C:\pyserial\pyserial-2.6<br>
    C:\Python33\python.exe setup.py install</font></li>
  <li>Delete the folder created in the first step (C:\pyserial).</li>
</ol>
<h3>MorseMHC</h3>
<p>MorseMHC is a program that was developed for the Civil War exhibit at the
Minnesota History Center. It receives text from the keyboard, a file, or a web
page, displays the text on the screen, and sends it as Morse to the speakers
and/or an attached sounder. In its default configuration, the text consists of
news dispatches from 150 years ago, and they're displayed on a Civil War-era
telegram form.</p>
<p>MorseMHC uses the MorseKOB 4.0 modules, and it can serve as a template for
implementing your own KOB program. Be sure to contact me if you need any help
with this.</p>
<h4>Installing MorseMHC</h4>
<p>To download the latest version of MorseMHC, go to <a href="http://morsekob.org/morsekob40/MorseMHC.zip">morsekob.org/morsekob40/MorseMHC.zip</a>
and copy the files and folders to a new folder (you could name it MorseMHC) on
your hard drive. The easiest way is just to open the zip file instead of saving
it, and then &quot;extract all files&quot; to the MorseMHC folder, creating a
new MorseMHC folder in the process if necessary.</p>
<h4>Running MorseMHC</h4>
<p>To run the program, open the MorseMHC folder and double-click on the
MorseMHC.py file. Your monitor should go into full-screen mode and Civil War
articles will start to appear on telegram forms that scroll off the top of the
screen as they're received. You should also hear Morse coming out of your
speakers.</p>
<p>The normal way of terminating the program is by pressing the Escape key. If
that doesn't work, you can get out of full-screen mode by pressing Alt-Tab. If
you lose control of your mouse, try pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del and then cancelling
out of the Task Manager menu.</p>
<p>If you like, you can create a shortcut to MorseMHC.py and place it on the
desktop. You can also copy the shortcut to the system startup folder to launch
the program automatically whenever Windows is booted.</p>
<p>If the program doesn't work as expected, run it again by double-clicking on
the MorseMHC test.bat file instead, and send me copies of the log.txt and
err.txt files that are created.</p>
<h4>Customizing MorseMHC</h4>
<p>If you open MorseMHC.py in a text editor, you'll see there are a number of
parameters near the beginning of the file that control various features. For
example, you can change the code speed, the number of articles that are sent
before repeating, and the amount of delay between articles and groups of
articles.</p>
<p>To drive an external sounder, you'll need to edit the file
...\MorseMHC\kob\sounder.py. You can use any text editor, such as Notepad. If
you want to get fancy, you can use the IDLE editor that comes with Python. In
any case, what you need to do is change the line that currently reads PORT =
'COM3' to whatever port your interface is on.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can change the color and layout of the telegram form and the
font size by modifying constants in the kob\display.py file. I recommend you
keep notes of any changes you make to these files, because if later on you
install an updated version of the program your changes will be lost and you'll
have to restore the changes.</p>
<p>Normally, MorseMHC fetches its Civil War articles from the MorseKOB web
server, and therefore it requires an internet connection. If you want to run the
program without an internet connection, you can configure it to get its data
from a local file instead. To do that, comment out the SOURCE =
'url=http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/rss/civilwar.xml' line by inserting a #
character at the beginning of the line, and uncomment the SOURCE =
'file=civilwar.xml' line.</p>
<p>If you comment out both of these lines and uncomment the SOURCE = None line,
then instead of fetching Civil War news articles the program takes input from
the keyboard and sends it in Morse to the sounder.</p>
