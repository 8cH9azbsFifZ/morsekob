<description>WASHINGTON, September 3.  From HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, SATURDAY, Aug. 29, 1863. The dull monotony of this Summer camp life has been agreeably broken within the past few days by the occurrence of one or two of those pleasant occasions which are not only agreeable in themselves, but serve to bind anew and with still stronger ties the affections of the soldiers to their leaders. The first occurred on Wednesday at Warrenton, when an elegant horse, sword, and set of equipments were presented to Gen. SEDGWICK, by the officers of his old command, the Second division of the Second Army Corps.</description>

<description>WASHINGTON, August 30.   The Army of the Cumberland has crossed the Tennessee River.  A dispatch received from Fortress Monroe yesterday, announced the reception of news there that Forts Sumter and Wagner were occupied by our forces on Monday last, the 24th.

We also have this morning an official dispatch from Gen. GILLMORE, dated the 24th, announcing the practical demolition of Sumter.</description>

<description>WASHINGTON, August 28.  The rebels have driven across Bayou Metairie Bridge, Arkansas, with considerable loss.  MORRIS ISLAND, S.C., Friday, Aug. 21, 1863. The orders issued by Gen. GILLMORE Sunday night, for the artillery commanders to open their batteries on the rebel works at daybreak Monday morning, did not, in consequence of the advanced state of our siege operations, create any undue surprise. News of attack was circulated with remarkable rapidity through the camp, and upon the countenances of the soldiers could be traced evidences of satisfaction, if not actual delight, at the prospect of being relieved of the monotonous life.</description>

<description>WASHINGTON, August 25.  DESERTIONS FROM LEE'S ARMY.  LEE's army is daily decreasing in strength -- the number of desertions from it outnumbering the conscripts daily joining it. At no previous period of the war has there been so great a disposition manifested to desert from it.   Deserters now number now four or five times as many as ever before, and by far the greater portion of them are natives. They unite in declaring that nine-tenths of those who are now deserting LEE make for their respective homes, instead of coming this way. They also say that the feeling that the rebel cause is lost is universal in the rebel army of Virginia.</description>

<description>WASHINGTON, August 10.  From MORTON, Mississippi, July 25, 1863. GRANT has fallen back toward Vicksburgh. The evacuation is likely permanent, and West Mississippi will be left to the mercy of raiders.  The gathering of a heavy naval force at Pensacola would indicate an early attack on Mobile, but the difficulties in the way of GRANT's participation in it are very great. He will hardly attempt it by land from the river. Want of water, hot weather and sickness will deter him. It is more probable that, content with his exploits in the South for the present, he will merely hold the strategic points he has gained, and operate the balk of his army somewhere North.</description>

<description>NEW YORK, June 8.   The telegraph has not taken the trouble either to contradict or confirm the story it brought us, a few days since, that the rebels had captured a regiment of negro soldiers at Helena, Arkansas, and had hung every man of them, with all their white officers. We should think that when it was thought worth while to startle the whole country with a rumor of this kind, it would also be considered worth while to contradict it when it was proven to be false. The absurd stories which are often telegraphed to the Press may, perhaps, not be thought worthy of contradiction, but the fact is they deceive many people, and leave many others in doubt.</description>

QN  The telegraph advises us that they have refused to do duty, unless Gen. HOOKER rescinds the order restricting their numbers to one to each division. This is quite in keeping with the general course of things in the army, so far as a portion of its officers and men are concerned. We are not at all surprised that the newsboys should have come to the conclusion that they had as good a right to command the army as Gen. HOOKER. He ought to get in the habit of submitting his orders for their approval, before issuing them. The sutlers may strike next.</description>

The uncertainty which has prevailed concerning the future financial policy of Government is somewhat relieved by the summary action of the House on the Loan bill.

Hereafter the California market will be liberally supplied with cotton goods from that quarter. Considering the present enormous prices of cotton goods in this country, this is not at all wonderful. Cotton can be raised in China cheaper than in any other part of the world, except the Southern States, owing to the great abundance and low price of labor.</description>
